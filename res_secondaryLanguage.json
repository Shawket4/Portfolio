    "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shawket Ibrahim :). I'm working with powerful Backend technologies like Golang and GoFiber, MySQL, and Django. To deliver highly scalable and fast web applications with built-in user authentication and user permissions with React, HTML, and CSS on the Frontend. I'm also quiet fluent in flutter for building cross platform mobile applications that work with the Backend to send and store data. Finally I'm currently training and taking courses to be a python data analyst. My latest project is \"Snap School Management System\" this is a system that I'm currently working on to manage school student, and teacher entries, record violations, and keep track of student, and teacher details. This project is a full stack system that takes advantage of Golang, MySQL, React, HTML, CSS, Python, Flutter, and Firebase. I have 3 colleagues working with my on the project and I'm the Backend Developer as well as the team leader. Thank You For Reading My Portfolio ðŸ’œ",
